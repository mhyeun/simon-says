1A MTE100/GENE121 Final Project - Simon Says

Simon Says is a memorization game that outputs a sequence of colours which the user must input back in the correct order.
The sequence is randomized with four distinct colours, and after each correct round, the difficulty increases by adding another button to the sequence.

This was the final project for the 1A term. This project was completed with three other group members.
Coded in ROBOTC and executed by an EV3 robot.
